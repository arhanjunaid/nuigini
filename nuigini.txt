10) UX Patterns & Screen Behavior

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Smart validation (address/vehicle lookups inline; explain price drivers).

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Docs tab on every key entity (Policy, Claim, Quote).

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Audit tab visible to Admin/Auditor roles.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Breakdown panel always shows Base, Fees, GST, Duty, ESL with tooltips.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Accessibility: WCAG AA, focus/contrast, keyboard flows.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Global search: policies, claims, parties.

11) Acceptance Criteria (samples)
Quote Rating
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Given valid Motor risk, when “Rate” is clicked, then a price returns ≤ 800ms P95 with breakdown fields present; UW rules evaluated; refer/decline reasons listed.

Bind
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Bind is blocked unless KYCStatus=Verified AND ReferralStatus=Cleared AND PaymentCaptured=true (unless product allows bind-on-auth, then captured within N hours or auto cancel).

Endorsement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Changing address triggers re-rate; proration uses actual/365; doc generated; audit entry includes before/after risk deltas.

Claims Payment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Any claim payment > threshold requires manager approval; sanction check re-run within T-24h; payment remits to verified payee only.

Reinsurance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * On bind, cession snapshot stored; monthly premium BDX reconciles to cashbook totals ± tolerance; recoveries allocate to claim components.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Reinsurance: QS 50% + XoL; premium and claim BDX agree with ledger; recovery posting reduces claim outstanding.

13) Next step (optional)
I can drop this into a clickable flow diagram + Next.js route map (files/folders) so your team can build directly. If you want that, say “make the canvas”, and I’ll generate a visual you can iterate on.
